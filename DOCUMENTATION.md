# Technical Documentation: Swirl Injector  

## 🌪️ Overview  
A **swirl injector** atomizes liquid propellants by imparting angular momentum, producing a fine, hollow conical spray. It is widely used in rocket engines for efficient combustion.

## 🔬 Observations and Challenges  
1. **Atomization Issues**: The spray may be uneven if the orifice is not precisely aligned.  
2. **Flow Instability**: Cavitation may occur if pressures are not optimized.
3. **Manufacturing Hurdles**: Complexity of the design leads to expensive, problematic, and inconsistent production.
4. **Test Challenges**: Unavailability of reliable testing systems could lead to delays or improper data gathering.
