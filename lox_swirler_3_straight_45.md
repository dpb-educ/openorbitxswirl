# Technical Documentation: LOX Swirler 3 Straight 45

## 1. Introduction
The LOX Swirler 3 Straight 45 is a critical component designed to induce a vortex effect in the liquid oxygen (LOX) flow for enhanced atomization and combustion efficiency. This document provides a technical overview, including design choices, material selection, expected performance considerations, and relevant engineering computations.

## 2. Design Overview
The design features four tangential holes positioned on the upper wall of the swirler to generate a vortex. The main structure incorporates multiple sections, threads, and angles, allowing integration into an RP2 Swirler system. 

### Key dimensions and features:
- 4 holes at an angle tangent to the inner wall
- 45-degree angle for flow optimization
- Male and female threaded interfaces for attachment
- Spotface usage if necessary for improved machining accuracy
- Diameters ranging from 1.50 mm to 34.70 mm for different flow control areas

## 3. Design Rationale
- **Vortex Generation:** The four tangential holes ensure effective swirling of LOX, improving atomization and combustion efficiency.
- **Threaded Interfaces:** The 20 mm internal thread and 16 mm external thread allow secure integration with existing manifold components.
- **Material Selection:** The use of **Brass or SS-304L** provides high strength, corrosion resistance, and cryogenic compatibility.
- **Thermal Considerations:** The component must withstand extreme temperatures ranging from -180°C (cryogenic conditions) to over 800°C (combustion interface).

## 4. Material Selection
The choice of **Brass or SS-304L** was made based on:
- **Cryogenic Compatibility:** Stainless steel (SS-304L) maintains mechanical integrity at extremely low temperatures.
- **Corrosion Resistance:** Both materials offer excellent resistance to oxidation and chemical wear.
- **Machinability:** Brass allows for easier machining, while SS-304L offers better durability under thermal cycling.

## 5. Manufacturing Considerations
- **Thread Machining:**
  - The internal and external threads must conform to standard tolerances for seamless assembly.
  - The 20 mm inner diameter must accommodate male threading, and the 16 mm external thread must fit within the manifold bore.
- **Hole Placement Precision:**
  - The 4 holes should be precisely drilled tangentially to the inner surface for proper vortex formation.
  - Spotface finishing is suggested to ensure smooth entry points for LOX.
- **Surface Treatment:**
  - Depending on the material, passivation (for SS-304L) or protective coatings (for Brass) may be needed.

## 6. Engineering Computations
### Flow Characteristics
- **Exit Velocity:** ~26.49 m/s (speed of LOX exiting the tangential holes)
- **Flow Rate per Hole:** ~\(6.66 \times 10^{-5}\) m³/s
- **Total Flow Rate:** ~\(2.66 \times 10^{-4}\) m³/s (all four holes combined)

### Swirl Strength (Vortex Formation)
- **Swirl Number:** ~0.40 (indicates moderate swirl; effective for atomization)

### Thermal Expansion Considerations
- **Nominal Length:** 34.7 mm
- **Expanded Length (after exposure to -180°C to 800°C):** ~35.28 mm (~0.58 mm expansion)
- **Conclusion:** The material expansion should be considered in tolerances but is within manageable limits.

### Structural Stress Analysis
- **Hoop Stress:** ~3.33 MPa (due to internal pressure of 5 bar)
- **Conclusion:** Well below the yield strength of SS-304L (~215 MPa), indicating structural integrity under operating conditions.

## 7. Expected Performance
- **Atomization Efficiency:** The vortex ensures uniform LOX dispersion, enhancing combustion.
- **Structural Integrity:** The material and design allow it to endure extreme thermal gradients without deformation.
- **Component Integration:** The threaded interfaces ensure a secure fit within the propulsion system.
